Mood is a machine learningâ€“powered web app that predicts the mood of a song based on its audio features like danceability, energy, valence, tempo, etc. It classifies songs into moods such as happy, sad, romantic, excited, dancing, workout, and tired. Users can input features to get mood predictions, view mood-wise song recommendations, and see a mood distribution chart. Built with a Python backend and React frontend.
